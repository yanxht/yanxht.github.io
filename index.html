<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>This is my personal website, where you can find information on my current research and professional development. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at <i>Azure Compute Insights</i> which builds analytics tools for large-scale cloud infrastructure.

<p>I earned my PhD in Statistics from Cornell University. My research centered on using convex optimization to solve structured feature selection problems in high dimensions. While working at Microsoft I got involved in developing scalable network models for networks with millions of nodes (check out <a href="https://yanxht.github.io/research/bar/">our proposal</a>). I also volunteer to provide statistical consulting for non-profit initiatives: collaborating with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-good">Microsoft AI for Good</a>, we published studies on the sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) in the US, e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002234762030010X">its geographic variation</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81613-w">the impact of high altitude</a>. </p>
