<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website, a space where I share updates on my professional journey and research endeavors. Currently, I am working as a Senior Data Scientist building analytics tools for large-scale cloud infrastructure at <i>Microsoft Azure</i>. Before that I earned my PhD in Statistics from Cornell University in 2018. My graduate research centered on using convex optimization to solve structured feature selection problems in high-dimensional spaces. My highlighted project at Azure is the development of <a href="https://yanxht.github.io/research/aegis/"><em>Aegis</em></a>, an end-to-end analytical service for attributing control plane change impact across computing layers and service components in large-scale cloud systems.</p>
