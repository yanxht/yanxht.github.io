<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is my personal website where you can find information on my current professional and research development. I am working as a Data Scientist building analytics tools for large-scale cloud infrastructure at <i>Azure</i>. I earned my PhD in Statistics from Cornell University in 2018. My graduate research centered on using convex optimization to solve structured feature selection problems in high dimensions.
