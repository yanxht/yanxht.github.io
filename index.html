<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>This is my personal website, where you can find information on my current research and professional development. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Azure Compute Insights which builds tools for large-scale cloud infrastructure. For example, our team develops <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/an-intelligent-end-to-end-analytics-service-for-safe-deployment-in-large-scale-cloud-infrastructure/">Gandalf</a>, an end-to-end analytics service for safe deployment in Azure.</p>

<p>I received my PhD in Statistics from Cornell University. My research interests focused on using convex optimization techniques to solve structured feature selection problems in high dimensions. After working at Microsoft I became interested in developing link prediction model for large networks at the scale of millions of nodes. I also provide statistical modeling support for non-profit initiatives: collaborating with researchers from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-good">Microsoft AI for Good</a> and <a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org">Seattle Children's Hospital</a>, we publish a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002234762030010X">study</a> on the geographic variation of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) across the US. </p>
