<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>This is my personal website, where you can find information on my current research and professional development. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at <i>Azure Compute Insights</i> which builds analytics tools for large-scale cloud infrastructure.

<p>I received my PhD in Statistics from Cornell University. My research centered on using convex optimization to solve structured feature selection problems in high dimensions. While working at Microsoft I got involved in developing scalable network models for networks with millions of nodes (check out <a href="https://yanxht.github.io/research/bar/">our proposal</a>). Outside of work, I volunteer and provide statistical modeling support for non-profit initiatives: collaborating with researchers from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-good">Microsoft AI for Good</a> and <a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org">Seattle Children's Hospital</a>, we published <a href="https://yanxht.github.io/research/other/">a paper</a> on the geographic variation of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) across the US. </p>
