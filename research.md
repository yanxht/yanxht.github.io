My graduate research primarily centered around *high dimensional statistics* where there are more variables than observations. As a Data Scientist, I got involved in various kinds of research at Microsoft, e.g., innovating *large-scale network modeling* to address the scalability constraint of traditional network models in modeling user behavior over our products.. Since joining Microsoft Azure, my research focus has shifted to *AIOps*, particularly using AI/ML to increase the reliability and resilience of large-scale cloud infrastructure and the quality of cloud computing service. I'll share my research here as they become publicly available.
