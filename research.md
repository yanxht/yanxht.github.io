My research interests primarily lie in two areas: *high dimensional statistics* for which there are more variables than observations, and *large-scale network modeling* (e.g., with millions of nodes) on which traditional network models fail due to scalability issues. In addition to these areas, I also provide statistical modeling support to non-profit initiatives such as [Microsoft AI for Good](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-good).
