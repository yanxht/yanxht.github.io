My name is Xiaohan Yan (or 颜啸晗 in Chinese). I was born and raised up in [Tai'an, Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an) until I was eighteen. My father was a first-generation college graduate coming from rural China. Very much knowing the value of higher education, he encouraged and supported me to pursue my studies in the US. Just as how I was grateful to my parents' support, I would be equally excited had I known that I would be spending my next decade on the other side of the globe. 

I went to [the University of Washington Seattle](https://www.washington.edu) for undergrad, during which I was attracted to statistics. My undergrad years (2009 - 2013) were at the dawn of the so-called *Big-Data* era: data analysis was unrecognized as a science yet, and schools were still using couple of hundreds as cutoff value for sample size in the Central Limit Theorem. After taking graduate-level statistics courses at UW, I had the desire to receive systematic training to master the tools for developing statistical model and theory. Another reason for applying PhD is that I'm very much fond of [Galen R. Shorack's](https://www.stat.washington.edu/galen/) corner office in Padelford Hall. I thought it would be cool to be a professor and own an office like that :)

From 2013 to 2018 I studied at [Cornell University Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Jacob Bien](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Jacob-Bien/), and [Martin T. Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells) and [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) are also on my committee. My PhD research focused on developing novel convex optimization models for achieving desirable structural patterns in model parameters. For example, in [a study](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01631) we compared two commonly used lasso-based regularizations in achieving hierarchical sparsity patterns in parameters. For more publications refer to [Research](https://yanxht.github.io/research/). The need for statistics professionals greatly increased in industry during the same time. Meanwhile, I gathered work experiences as data scientist in the tech industry through summer internships (which also compensated my modest stipend). Finally, I decided to join Microsoft and moved back to Seattle after getting my PhD degree. My elder daughter was born in Ithaca NY at the beginning of my fourth year PhD. Such a joyful memory!

I am now living with my wife and two daughters on the East Side of the Greater Seattle area. I enjoy reading, gardening and playing with my kids in my spare time.
