My name is Xiaohan Yan (or 颜啸晗 in Chinese). I was born and grew up in [Tai'an, Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an) until I was eighteen years old. My father was a first-generation college graduate from rural China. Very much knowing the value of higher education, he encouraged and supported me to pursue my studies in the US. Just as how I am grateful to my parents for their support, I would be equally excited had I known that I would be spending my next decade of life on the other side of the pacific ocean. 

I went to [the University of Washington Seattle](https://www.washington.edu) for undergraduate study, during which I was attracted to the beauty of statistical theories and the great applicability of statistics. My undergrad years (2009 - 2013) were at the dawn of the so-called "Big-Data" era: data analysis was yet unrecognized as a science, deep learning had not become popular again, and schools were still using 30 as the cutoff value for sample size to be considered as "large enough" in the Central Limit Theorem. After taking all advanced level undergrad courses and some graduate level statistics, I felt that I hadn't learned enough about statistics, and I had the desire to receive systematic training to master the tools for developing statistical model and theorey. Another reason for applying PhD is that I'm very much fond of [Galen R. Shorack's](https://www.stat.washington.edu/galen/) corner office in the Padelford Hall. I thought it would be cool to become a professor and own an office like that :)
