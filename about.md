I'm Xiaohan Yan (颜啸晗 in Chinese), originally from [Tai'an, Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an). My parents were first-generation college graduates from rural China. Very much knowing the value of higher education, they supported me to pursue my studies in the States.

I went to [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) from 2009 to 2013, where I developed a passion for statistics just as the *Big Data* era was unfolding. After taking advanced statistics courses, I had an aspiration to delve deeper into statistical models and theory. As an undergrad, I engaged in research on China's energy efficiency, funded by the *Mary Gates Endowment* scholarship. This pivotal experience carved my path as a statistician.

From 2013 to 2018 I pursued my PhD study at [Cornell University Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu). I was very fortunate to be advised by [Jacob Bien](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Jacob-Bien/), and [Martin T. Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells) and [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) were also on my committee. My [PhD research](https://yanxht.github.io/research/) focused on developing novel convex optimization models for achieving desirable structural patterns in model parameters. Parallel to academic pursuits, I gathered work experiences in tech firms through internships (which also supplemented my modest graduate student stipend.) Post-PhD, I joined Microsoft as a Data Scientist and moved back to Seattle.

I am working as a Tech Lead for my team in Microsoft Azure Core. My primary role involves enhancing AI/ML analytical solutions for large-scale cloud infrastructure, particularly in AIOps. My aim is ensuring Azure's service quality through detecting/attributing/mitigating platform issues in cloud computing. I actively lead collaborations between my team and research units, such as Microsoft Research.

Outside work, residing by Lake Washington's East Side, I relish reading, gardening, and engaging in sports with loved ones.
