My name is Xiaohan Yan (颜啸晗 in Chinese). I grew up in [Tai'an, Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an) until I was eighteen. My parents are first-generation college graduates coming from rural China. Very much knowing the value of higher education, they supported me to pursue my studies in the States.

I went to [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) for undergrad, during which I was attracted to statistics. My undergrad years (2009 - 2013) were at the dawn of the *Big Data* era and *Data Scientist* was yet to be recognized as a profession. After taking graduate-level statistics courses in junior year, I had the desire to receive systematic training to master the tools for developing statistical models and theory. As an undergrad, I received a scholarship from *the Mary Gates Endowment*, which supported me to conduct research on China's energy efficiency. The research experience had a big impact on me and influenced the introduction of my career as a statistician. 

Between 2013 and 2018 I pursued my PhD study at [Cornell University Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu). I was very fortunate to be advised by [Jacob Bien](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Jacob-Bien/) (now at USC), and [Martin T. Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells) and [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) were also on my committee. My [graduate research](https://yanxht.github.io/research/) focused on developing novel convex optimization models for achieving desirable structural patterns in model parameters. During my PhD the demand for statistics professionals greatly increased in the tech industry. Meanwhile, I gathered work experiences in tech companies through internships (which also supplemented my modest graduate student stipend.) Finally, I decided to join Microsoft as a data scientist and moved back to Seattle after getting my PhD.

I am working as a Data Scientist lead in Azure Core, building analytical solutions for large-scale cloud infrastructure, with a focus in *AIOps*. My work involves maintaining and innovating AI/ML-based analytical solutions for detecting/attributing/mitigating platform issues in cloud computing, with the goal to uphold the quality of Azure service for our customers. Still active on AIOps-related research, I lead innovation and collaboration efforts of my team with the research community (e.g., Microsoft Research).

Living on the East Side of Lake Washington, I enjoy reading, gardening and playing sports with my family and friends out of work.
