My name is Xiaohan Yan or 颜啸晗 in Chinese. I was born and raised in [Tai'an, Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an) until I was eighteen. My father was a first-generation college graduate coming from rural China. Very much knowing the value of higher education, he encouraged and supported me to pursue my studies in the US. But neither of us forecast my following decade would be spent on the other side of the globe.

I went to [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) for undergrad, during which I was attracted to statistics. My undergrad years (2009 - 2013) were at the dawn of the so-called *Big Data* era: data analysis was unrecognized as a science yet, and schools were still using a couple of hundreds as cutoff value for sample size in applying the Central Limit Theorem. After taking graduate-level statistics courses at UW, I had the desire to receive systematic training to master the tools for developing statistical models and theory. 
<!---So, I applied for PhD programs in statistics. Another reason for applying for a PhD was that I was very fond of [Galen R. Shorack's](https://www.stat.washington.edu/galen/) corner office in Padelford Hall. I thought it would be cool to be a professor and own an office like that :)--->

From 2013 to 2018 I studied at [Cornell University Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu). I was very fortunate to be advised by [Jacob Bien](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Jacob-Bien/) (now at University of Southern California), and [Martin T. Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells) and [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) were also on my committee. My PhD research focused on developing novel convex optimization models for achieving desirable structural patterns in model parameters. To learn more about my research please check out [Research](https://yanxht.github.io/research/). During my PhD the need for statistics professionals greatly increased in the industry. Meanwhile, I gathered work experiences in tech companies through internships (which also supplemented my modest graduate student stipend). Finally, I decided to join Microsoft as a Data Scientist and moved back to Seattle after getting my PhD.

I am now living with my wife and two daughters on the east side of Lake Washington. I enjoy reading, gardening, hiking and playing with my kids in my spare time.
