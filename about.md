My name is Xiaohan Yan (or 颜啸晗 in Chinese). I was born and grew up in [Tai'an, Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an) until I was eighteen years old. My father was a first-generation college graduate from rural China. Very much knowing the value of higher education, he encouraged and supported me to pursue my studies in the US.
