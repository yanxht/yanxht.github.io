My name is Xiaohan Yan (or 颜啸晗 in Chinese). I was born and raised up in [Tai'an, Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an) until I was eighteen years old. My father was a first-generation college graduate coming from rural China. Very much knowing the value of higher education, he encouraged and supported me to pursue my studies in the US. Just as how I was grateful to my parents' support, I would be equally excited had I forecasted that I would be spending my next decade of life on the other side of the Pacific ocean. 

I went to [the University of Washington Seattle](https://www.washington.edu) for undergrad study, during which I was attracted to statistics by its great applicability. My undergrad years (2009 - 2013) were at the dawn of the so-called **Big-Data** era: data analysis was yet unrecognized as a science, and schools were still using 30 as the cutoff value for sample size to be considered as *large enough* in the Central Limit Theorem. After taking some graduate level statistics, I had the intrinsic motivation to receive systematic training to master the tools for developing statistical model and theory. Another reason for applying PhD is that I'm very much fond of [Galen R. Shorack's](https://www.stat.washington.edu/galen/) corner office in the Padelford Hall. I thought it would be cool to become a professor and own an office like that :)
