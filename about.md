My name is Xiaohan Yan (or 颜啸晗 in Chinese). I was born and raised in [Tai'an, Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai%27an) until I was eighteen. My father was a first-generation college graduate coming from rural China. Very much knowing the value of higher education, he encouraged and supported me to pursue my studies in the US. Just as how I was grateful to my parents' support, I would be equally excited had I known that I would be spending my next decade on the other side of the globe. 

I went to [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) for undergrad, during which I was attracted to statistics. My undergrad years (2009 - 2013) were at the dawn of the so-called *Big Data* era: data analysis was unrecognized as a science yet, and schools were still using a couple of hundreds as cutoff value for sample size in the Central Limit Theorem. After taking graduate-level statistics courses at UW, I had the desire to receive systematic training to master the tools for developing statistical models and theory. Another reason for applying for a PhD is that I'm very much fond of [Galen R. Shorack's](https://www.stat.washington.edu/galen/) corner office in Padelford Hall. I thought it would be cool to be a professor and own an office like that :)

From 2013 to 2018 I studied at [Cornell University Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Jacob Bien](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Jacob-Bien/) (now at University of Southern California), and [Martin T. Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells) and [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) are also on my committee. My PhD research focused on developing novel convex optimization models for achieving desirable structural patterns in model parameters. For example, in [a study](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01631) we compared two commonly used group lasso regularizations in achieving hierarchical sparsity patterns in model parameters. For more research projects refer to [Research](https://yanxht.github.io/research/). The need for statistics professionals greatly increased in industry during my PhD. Meanwhile, I gathered work experiences as a Data Scientist in tech companies through summer internships (which also compensated my modest graduate student stipend). Finally, I decided to join Microsoft as a Data Scientist and moved back to Seattle after getting my PhD. My elder daughter was born in [Ithaca NY](https://www.visitithaca.com/node/1) at the beginning of my fourth year PhD. Such a joyful memory!

I am now living with my wife and two daughters on the east side of Lake Washington. I enjoy reading, gardening, hiking and playing with my kids in my spare time.
